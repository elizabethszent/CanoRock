# CanoRock
Rocket course in Norway funded by the Canadian Space Agency

This code uses data from 8 sensors placed on a rocket to track varires factors such as pressure, speed, temperature, acceleration, speed, optical, rotational and more. 

A data file is nesssary to run this code which includes the data tracked in a program known as DEWESoft. 
I am unable to provide this file as the program can only be run with very expensive equipment. I wrote the program and entered multiple equations realting to the sensors.
